# Melanoma Detection Using CNN
> To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis

## General Information
- A a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early.
- It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths.
- A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
- The dataset contains 2239 training images and 118 Test images.


## Conclusions
- The model overfits if aumentation is not done.
- To treat class imbalance, augmentation library is used whihc mitigates the problem of low accuracy.
- The final model has a training accuracy 74.5% and validation accuracy of 73.57%.


## Libraries Used
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Tensorflow/Keras
